Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. This means that if a signal is triggered within a transaction, the actions performed in the signal will be part of that transaction. If the transaction is rolled back, any changes made in the signal will also be rolled back.

Files provided demonstrate this behavior using the post_save signal.
